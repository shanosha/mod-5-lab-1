# Summary

Dynamic shopping cart that allows you to add items and prices. You cannot add an item without a name, or with a price at zero or lower.

## Reflections

- Using vanilla javascript methods like creatElementById, for example.

What steps did you take to ensure accurate updates to the total price?

- That was the easy part, I used simple math calculations.

How did you handle invalid input for product name or price?

- I used try and catch combined with if statements.

What challenges did you face when implementing the remove functionality?

- I decided to add a dataset id to each button to assist with removing the item from the array befor rendering it.
